## Project description

The dataset we plan to use is the CQ500 dataset, which contains 491 head CT scans with a total of 193,317 slices. The scans were generously provided by the Centre for Advanced Research in Imaging, Neurosciences and Genomics (CARING) in New Delhi, India, and were read by three experienced radiologists with 8, 12, and 20 years of experience in cranial CT interpretation.

The goal of our project is to develop an image segmentation model that can accurately detect the presence of brain hemorrhages in CT scan images. By using machine learning techniques, our model will be trained on labeled CT scans to identify areas where a hemorrhage is present. This will allow for earlier detection and treatment of brain hemorrhages, which can lead to better patient outcomes and improved quality of life.

The CQ500 dataset is an ideal choice for this project, as it provides a large and diverse set of scans with radiologists' reads, allowing for thorough training and validation of the image segmentation model. However, working with medical imaging data requires careful consideration of privacy and ethical concerns, and we will ensure that all necessary measures are taken to protect patient confidentiality and respect ethical guidelines.
